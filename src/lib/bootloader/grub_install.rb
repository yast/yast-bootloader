      # EFI has 2 boot paths. The default is that there is a target file listed
      # in the boot list. The boot list is stored in NVRAM and exposed as
      # efivars.
      #
      # If no entry in the boot list was bootable (or a removable media is in
      # the boot list), EFI falls back to removable media booting which loads
      # a default file from /efi/boot/boot.efi.
      #
      # On U-Boot EFI capable systems we do not have NVRAM because we would
      # have to store that on the same flash that Linux may be running on,
      # creating device ownership conflicts. So on those systems we instead have
      # to rely on the removable boot case.
      #
      # The easiest heuristic is that on "normal" EFI systems with working
      # NVRAM, there is at least one efi variable visible. On systems without
      # working NVRAM, we either see no efivars at all (booted via non-EFI entry
      # point) or there is no efi variable exposed. Install grub in the
      # removable location there.
